## First 60 seconds if something's broken

1) **Quick status (first check)**
   ```bash
   clawdbot status
   ```
   Fast local summary: OS + update, gateway/daemon reachability, agents/sessions, provider config + runtime issues (when gateway is reachable).

2) **Pasteable report (safe to share)**
   ```bash
   clawdbot status --all
   ```
   Read-only diagnosis with log tail (tokens redacted).

3) **Daemon + port state**
   ```bash
   clawdbot daemon status
   ```
   Shows supervisor runtime vs RPC reachability, the probe target URL, and which config the daemon likely used.

4) **Deep probes**
   ```bash
   clawdbot status --deep
   ```
   Runs gateway health checks + provider probes (requires a reachable gateway). See [Health](/gateway/health).

5) **Tail the latest log**
   ```bash
   clawdbot logs --follow
   ```
   If RPC is down, fall back to:
   ```bash
   tail -f "$(ls -t /tmp/clawdbot/clawdbot-*.log | head -1)"
   ```
   File logs are separate from service logs; see [Logging](/logging) and [Troubleshooting](/gateway/troubleshooting).

6) **Run the doctor (repairs)**
   ```bash
   clawdbot doctor
   ```
   Repairs/migrates config/state + runs health checks. See [Doctor](/gateway/doctor).

7) **Gateway snapshot**
   ```bash
   clawdbot health --json
   clawdbot health --verbose   # shows the target URL + config path on errors
   ```
   Asks the running gateway for a full snapshot (WS-only). See [Health](/gateway/health).

## What is Clawdbot?

### What is Clawdbot, in one paragraph?

Clawdbot is a personal AI assistant you run on your own devices. It replies on the messaging surfaces you already use (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Signal, iMessage, WebChat) and can also do voice + a live Canvas on supported platforms. The **Gateway** is the always‑on control plane; the assistant is the product.

## Quick start and first-run setup

### What’s the recommended way to install and set up Clawdbot?

The repo recommends running from source and using the onboarding wizard:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot.git
cd clawdbot

pnpm install

# Optional if you want built output / global linking:
pnpm build

# If the Control UI assets are missing or you want the dashboard:
pnpm ui:build # auto-installs UI deps on first run

pnpm clawdbot onboard
```

The wizard can also build UI assets automatically. After onboarding, you typically run the Gateway on port **18789**.

### How do I open the dashboard after onboarding?

The wizard now opens your browser with a tokenized dashboard URL right after onboarding and also prints the full link (with token) in the summary. Keep that tab open; if it didn’t launch, copy/paste the printed URL on the same machine. Tokens stay local to your host—nothing is fetched from the browser.

### How do I authenticate the dashboard (token) on localhost vs remote?

**Localhost (same machine):**
- Open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/`.
- If it asks for auth, run `clawdbot dashboard` and use the tokenized link (`?token=...`).
- The token is the same value as `gateway.auth.token` (or `CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN`) and is stored by the UI after first load.

**Not on localhost:**
- **Tailscale Serve** (recommended): keep bind loopback, run `clawdbot gateway --tailscale serve`, open `https://<magicdns>/`. If `gateway.auth.allowTailscale` is `true`, identity headers satisfy auth (no token).
- **Tailnet bind**: run `clawdbot gateway --bind tailnet --token "<token>"`, open `http://<tailscale-ip>:18789/`, paste token in dashboard settings.
- **SSH tunnel**: `ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@host` then open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/?token=...` from `clawdbot dashboard`.

See [Dashboard](/web/dashboard) and [Web surfaces](/web) for bind modes and auth details.

### What runtime do I need?

Node **>= 22** is required. `pnpm` is recommended. Bun is **not recommended** for the Gateway.

### What does the onboarding wizard actually do?

`clawdbot onboard` is the recommended setup path. In **local mode** it walks you through:

- **Model/auth setup** (Anthropic **setup-token** recommended for Claude subscriptions, OpenAI Codex OAuth supported, API keys optional, LM Studio local models supported)
- **Workspace** location + bootstrap files
- **Gateway settings** (bind/port/auth/tailscale)
- **Providers** (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Signal, iMessage)
- **Daemon install** (LaunchAgent on macOS; systemd user unit on Linux/WSL2)
- **Health checks** and **skills** selection

It also warns if your configured model is unknown or missing auth.

### How does Anthropic "setup-token" auth work?

The wizard can run `claude setup-token` on the gateway host (or you run it yourself), then stores the token as an auth profile for the **anthropic** provider. That profile is used for model calls the same way an API key or OAuth profile would be. If you already ran `claude setup-token`, pick **Anthropic token (paste setup-token)** and paste it. More detail: [OAuth](/concepts/oauth).

### Do you support Claude subscription auth (Claude Code OAuth)?

Yes. Clawdbot can **reuse Claude Code CLI credentials** (OAuth) and also supports **setup-token**. If you have a Claude subscription, we recommend **setup-token** on the gateway host for the most reliable long‑running setup (requires Claude Pro/Max + the `claude` CLI). OAuth reuse is supported, but avoid logging in separately via Clawdbot and Claude Code to prevent token conflicts. See [Anthropic](/providers/anthropic) and [OAuth](/concepts/oauth).

Note: Claude subscription access is governed by Anthropic’s terms. For production or multi‑user workloads, API keys are usually the safer choice.

### Is AWS Bedrock supported?

Yes — via pi‑ai’s **Amazon Bedrock (Converse)** provider with **manual config**. You must supply AWS credentials/region on the gateway host and add a Bedrock provider entry in your models config. See [Amazon Bedrock](/bedrock) and [Model providers](/providers/models). If you prefer a managed key flow, an OpenAI‑compatible proxy in front of Bedrock is still a valid option.

### How does Codex auth work?

Clawdbot supports **OpenAI Code (Codex)** via OAuth or by reusing your Codex CLI login (`~/.codex/auth.json`). The wizard can import the CLI login or run the OAuth flow and will set the default model to `openai-codex/gpt-5.2` when appropriate. See [Model providers](/concepts/model-providers) and [Wizard](/start/wizard).

### Is a local model OK for casual chats?

Usually no. Clawdbot needs large context + strong safety; small cards truncate and leak. If you must, run the **largest** MiniMax M2.1 build you can locally (LM Studio) and see [/gateway/local-models](/gateway/local-models). Smaller/quantized models increase prompt-injection risk — see [Security](/gateway/security).

### How do I keep hosted model traffic in a specific region?

Pick region-pinned endpoints. OpenRouter exposes US-hosted options for MiniMax, Kimi, and GLM; choose the US-hosted variant to keep data in-region. You can still list Anthropic/OpenAI alongside these by using `models.mode: "merge"` so fallbacks stay available while respecting the regioned provider you select.

### Can I use Bun?

Bun is **not recommended**. We see runtime bugs, especially with WhatsApp and Telegram.
Use **Node** for stable gateways.

If you still want to experiment with Bun, do it on a non‑production gateway
without WhatsApp/Telegram.

### Telegram: what goes in `allowFrom`?

`channels.telegram.allowFrom` is **the human sender’s Telegram user ID** (numeric, recommended) or `@username`. It is not the bot username. To find your ID, DM `@userinfobot` or read the `from.id` in the gateway log for a DM. See [/channels/telegram](/channels/telegram#access-control-dms--groups).

### Can multiple people use one WhatsApp number with different Clawdbots?

Yes, via **multi‑agent routing**. Bind each sender’s WhatsApp **DM** (peer `kind: "dm"`, sender E.164 like `+15551234567`) to a different `agentId`, so each person gets their own workspace and session store. Replies still come from the **same WhatsApp account**, and DM access control (`channels.whatsapp.dmPolicy` / `channels.whatsapp.allowFrom`) is global per WhatsApp account. See [Multi-Agent Routing](/concepts/multi-agent) and [WhatsApp](/channels/whatsapp).

### Can I run a "fast chat" agent and an "Opus for coding" agent?

Yes. Use multi‑agent routing: give each agent its own default model, then bind inbound routes (provider account or specific peers) to each agent. Example config lives in [Multi-Agent Routing](/concepts/multi-agent). See also [Models](/concepts/models) and [Configuration](/gateway/configuration).

### Does Homebrew work on Linux?

Yes. Homebrew supports Linux (Linuxbrew). Quick setup:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.profile
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
brew install <formula>
```

If you run Clawdbot via systemd, ensure the service PATH includes `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin` (or your brew prefix) so `brew`-installed tools resolve in non‑login shells.

### Can I switch between npm and git installs later?

Yes. Install the other flavor, then run Doctor so the gateway service points at the new entrypoint.

From npm → git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot.git
cd clawdbot
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm clawdbot doctor
clawdbot daemon restart
```

From git → npm:

```bash
npm install -g clawdbot@latest
clawdbot doctor
clawdbot daemon restart
```

Doctor detects a gateway service entrypoint mismatch and offers to rewrite the service config to match the current install (use `--repair` in automation).

### Should I run the Gateway on my laptop or a VPS?

Short answer: **if you want 24/7 reliability, use a VPS**. If you want the
lowest friction and you’re okay with sleep/restarts, run it locally.

**Laptop (local Gateway)**
- **Pros:** no server cost, direct access to local files, live browser window.
- **Cons:** sleep/network drops = disconnects, OS updates/reboots interrupt, must stay awake.

**VPS / cloud**
- **Pros:** always‑on, stable network, no laptop sleep issues, easier to keep running.
- **Cons:** often run headless (use screenshots), remote file access only, you must SSH for updates.

**Clawdbot‑specific note:** WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/Discord all work fine from a VPS. The only real trade‑off is **headless browser** vs a visible window. See [Browser](/tools/browser).

**Recommended default:** VPS if you had gateway disconnects before. Local is great when you’re actively using the Mac and want local file access or UI automation with a visible browser.

## Skills and automation

### How do I customize skills without keeping the repo dirty?

Use managed overrides instead of editing the repo copy. Put your changes in `~/.clawdbot/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (or add a folder via `skills.load.extraDirs` in `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`). Precedence is `<workspace>/skills` > `~/.clawdbot/skills` > bundled, so managed overrides win without touching git. Only upstream-worthy edits should live in the repo and go out as PRs.

### Can I load skills from a custom folder?

Yes. Add extra directories via `skills.load.extraDirs` in `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` (lowest precedence). Default precedence remains: `<workspace>/skills` → `~/.clawdbot/skills` → bundled → `skills.load.extraDirs`. `clawdhub` installs into `./skills` by default, which Clawdbot treats as `<workspace>/skills`.

### How can I use different models for different tasks?

Today the supported patterns are:
- **Cron jobs**: isolated jobs can set a `model` override per job.
- **Sub-agents**: route tasks to separate agents with different default models.
- **On-demand switch**: use `/model` to switch the current session model at any time.

See [Cron jobs](/automation/cron-jobs), [Multi-Agent Routing](/concepts/multi-agent), and [Slash commands](/tools/slash-commands).

### How do I install skills on Linux?

Use **ClawdHub** (CLI) or drop skills into your workspace. The macOS Skills UI isn’t available on Linux.
Browse skills at https://clawdhub.com.

Install the ClawdHub CLI (pick one package manager):

```bash
npm i -g clawdhub
```

```bash
pnpm add -g clawdhub
```

### Do you have a Notion or HeyGen integration?

Not built‑in today.

Options:
- **Custom skill / plugin:** best for reliable API access (Notion/HeyGen both have APIs).
- **Browser automation:** works without code but is slower and more fragile.

If you want to keep context per client (agency workflows), a simple pattern is:
- One Notion page per client (context + preferences + active work).
- Ask the agent to fetch that page at the start of a session.

If you want a native integration, open a feature request or build a skill
targeting those APIs.

Install skills:

```bash
clawdhub install <skill-slug>
clawdhub update --all
```

ClawdHub installs into `./skills` under your current directory (or falls back to your configured Clawdbot workspace); Clawdbot treats that as `<workspace>/skills` on the next session. For shared skills across agents, place them in `~/.clawdbot/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Some skills expect binaries installed via Homebrew; on Linux that means Linuxbrew (see the Homebrew Linux FAQ entry above). See [Skills](/tools/skills) and [ClawdHub](/tools/clawdhub).

## Sandboxing and memory

### Is there a dedicated sandboxing doc?

Yes. See [Sandboxing](/gateway/sandboxing). For Docker-specific setup (full gateway in Docker or sandbox images), see [Docker](/install/docker).

### How do I bind a host folder into the sandbox?

Set `agents.defaults.sandbox.docker.binds` to `["host:path:mode"]` (e.g., `"/home/user/src:/src:ro"`). Global + per-agent binds merge; per-agent binds are ignored when `scope: "shared"`. Use `:ro` for anything sensitive and remember binds bypass the sandbox filesystem walls. See [Sandboxing](/gateway/sandboxing#custom-bind-mounts) and [Sandbox vs Tool Policy vs Elevated](/gateway/sandbox-vs-tool-policy-vs-elevated#bind-mounts-security-quick-check) for examples and safety notes.

### How does memory work?

Clawdbot memory is just Markdown files in the agent workspace:
- Daily notes in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Curated long-term notes in `MEMORY.md` (main/private sessions only)

Clawdbot also runs a **silent pre-compaction memory flush** to remind the model
to write durable notes before auto-compaction. This only runs when the workspace
is writable (read-only sandboxes skip it). See [Memory](/concepts/memory).

### Does semantic memory search require an OpenAI API key?

Only if you use **remote embeddings** (OpenAI). Codex OAuth covers
chat/completions and does **not** grant embeddings access, so **signing in with
Codex (OAuth or the Codex CLI login)** does not help for semantic memory search.
Remote memory search still needs a real OpenAI API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY` or
`models.providers.openai.apiKey`). If you’d rather stay local, set
`memorySearch.provider = "local"` (and optionally `memorySearch.fallback =
"none"`). We support **remote or local embedding models** — see [Memory](/concepts/memory)
for the setup details.

## Where things live on disk

### Where does Clawdbot store its data?

Everything lives under `$CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR` (default: `~/.clawdbot`):

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `$CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR/clawdbot.json` | Main config (JSON5) |
| `$CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR/credentials/oauth.json` | Legacy OAuth import (copied into auth profiles on first use) |
| `$CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json` | Auth profiles (OAuth + API keys) |
| `$CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth.json` | Runtime auth cache (managed automatically) |
| `$CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR/credentials/` | Provider state (e.g. `whatsapp/<accountId>/creds.json`) |
| `$CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR/agents/` | Per‑agent state (agentDir + sessions) |
| `$CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR/agents/<agentId>/sessions/` | Conversation history & state (per agent) |
| `$CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR/agents/<agentId>/sessions/sessions.json` | Session metadata (per agent) |

Legacy single‑agent path: `~/.clawdbot/agent/*` (migrated by `clawdbot doctor`).

Your **workspace** (AGENTS.md, memory files, skills, etc.) is separate and configured via `agents.defaults.workspace` (default: `~/clawd`).

### Where should AGENTS.md / SOUL.md / USER.md / MEMORY.md live?

These files live in the **agent workspace**, not `~/.clawdbot`.

- **Workspace (per agent)**: `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`,
  `MEMORY.md` (or `memory.md`), `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, optional `HEARTBEAT.md`.
- **State dir (`~/.clawdbot`)**: config, credentials, auth profiles, sessions, logs,
  and shared skills (`~/.clawdbot/skills`).

Default workspace is `~/clawd`, configurable via:

```json5
{
  agents: { defaults: { workspace: "~/clawd" } }
}
```

If the bot “forgets” after a restart, confirm the Gateway is using the same
workspace on every launch (and remember: remote mode uses the **gateway host’s**
workspace, not your local laptop).

See [Agent workspace](/concepts/agent-workspace) and [Memory](/concepts/memory).

### How do I completely uninstall Clawdbot?

See the dedicated guide: [Uninstall](/install/uninstall).

### Can agents work outside the workspace?

Yes. The workspace is the **default cwd** and memory anchor, not a hard sandbox.
Relative paths resolve inside the workspace, but absolute paths can access other
host locations unless sandboxing is enabled. If you need isolation, use
[`agents.defaults.sandbox`](/gateway/sandboxing) or per‑agent sandbox settings. If you
want a repo to be the default working directory, point that agent’s
`workspace` to the repo root. The Clawdbot repo is just source code; keep the
workspace separate unless you intentionally want the agent to work inside it.

Example (repo as default cwd):

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      workspace: "~/Projects/my-repo"
    }
  }
}
```

### I’m in remote mode — where is the session store?

Session state is owned by the **gateway host**. If you’re in remote mode, the session store you care about is on the remote machine, not your local laptop. See [Session management](/concepts/session).

## Config basics

### What format is the config? Where is it?

Clawdbot reads an optional **JSON5** config from `$CLAWDBOT_CONFIG_PATH` (default: `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`):

```
$CLAWDBOT_CONFIG_PATH
```

If the file is missing, it uses safe‑ish defaults (including a default workspace of `~/clawd`).

### I set `gateway.bind: "lan"` (or `"tailnet"`) and now nothing listens / the UI says unauthorized

Non-loopback binds **require auth**. Configure `gateway.auth.mode` + `gateway.auth.token` (or use `CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN`).

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    bind: "lan",
    auth: {
      mode: "token",
      token: "replace-me"
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- `gateway.remote.token` is for **remote CLI calls** only; it does not enable local gateway auth.
- The Control UI authenticates via `connect.params.auth.token` (stored in app/UI settings). Avoid putting tokens in URLs.

### Why do I need a token on localhost now?

The wizard generates a gateway token by default (even on loopback) so **local WS clients must authenticate**. This blocks other local processes from calling the Gateway. Paste the token into the Control UI settings (or your client config) to connect.

If you **really** want open loopback, remove `gateway.auth` from your config. Doctor can generate a token for you any time: `clawdbot doctor --generate-gateway-token`.

### Do I have to restart after changing config?

The Gateway watches the config and supports hot‑reload:

- `gateway.reload.mode: "hybrid"` (default): hot‑apply safe changes, restart for critical ones
- `hot`, `restart`, `off` are also supported

### How do I run a central Gateway with specialized workers across devices?

The common pattern is **one Gateway** (e.g. Raspberry Pi) plus **nodes** and **agents**:

- **Gateway (central):** owns channels (Signal/WhatsApp), routing, and sessions.
- **Nodes (devices):** Macs/iOS/Android connect as peripherals and expose local tools (`system.run`, `canvas`, `camera`).
- **Agents (workers):** separate brains/workspaces for special roles (e.g. “Hetzner ops”, “Personal data”).
- **Sub‑agents:** spawn background work from a main agent when you want parallelism.
- **TUI:** connect to the Gateway and switch agents/sessions.

Docs: [Nodes](/nodes), [Remote access](/gateway/remote), [Multi-Agent Routing](/concepts/multi-agent), [Sub-agents](/tools/subagents), [TUI](/tui).

### Can the Clawdbot browser run headless?

Yes. It’s a config option:

```json5
{
  browser: { headless: true },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      sandbox: { browser: { headless: true } }
    }
  }
}
```

Default is `false` (headful). Headless is more likely to trigger anti‑bot checks on some sites. See [Browser](/tools/browser).

Headless uses the **same Chromium engine** and works for most automation (forms, clicks, scraping, logins). The main differences:
- No visible browser window (use screenshots if you need visuals).
- Some sites are stricter about automation in headless mode (CAPTCHAs, anti‑bot).
  For example, X/Twitter often blocks headless sessions.

## Remote gateways + nodes

### How do commands propagate between Telegram, the gateway, and nodes?

Telegram messages are handled by the **gateway**. The gateway runs the agent and
only then calls nodes over the **Bridge** when a node tool is needed:

Telegram → Gateway → Agent → `node.*` → Node → Gateway → Telegram

Nodes don’t see inbound provider traffic; they only receive bridge RPC calls.

### Do nodes run a gateway daemon?

No. Only **one gateway** should run per host. Nodes are peripherals that connect
to the gateway (iOS/Android nodes, or macOS “node mode” in the menubar app).

A full restart is required for `gateway`, `bridge`, `discovery`, and `canvasHost` changes.

### Is there an API / RPC way to apply config?

Yes. `config.apply` validates + writes the full config and restarts the Gateway as part of the operation.

### What’s a minimal “sane” config for a first install?

```json5
{
  agents: { defaults: { workspace: "~/clawd" } },
  channels: { whatsapp: { allowFrom: ["+15555550123"] } }
}
```

This sets your workspace and restricts who can trigger the bot.

### How do I set up Tailscale on a VPS and connect from my Mac?

Minimal steps:

1) **Install + login on the VPS**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
   sudo tailscale up
   ```
2) **Install + login on your Mac**
   - Use the Tailscale app and sign in to the same tailnet.
3) **Enable MagicDNS (recommended)**
   - In the Tailscale admin console, enable MagicDNS so the VPS has a stable name.
4) **Use the tailnet hostname**
   - SSH: `ssh user@your-vps.tailnet-xxxx.ts.net`
   - Gateway WS: `ws://your-vps.tailnet-xxxx.ts.net:18789`

If you want the Control UI without SSH, use Tailscale Serve on the VPS:
```bash
clawdbot gateway --tailscale serve
```
This keeps the gateway bound to loopback and exposes HTTPS via Tailscale. See [Tailscale](/gateway/tailscale).

### How do I connect a Mac node to a remote Gateway (Tailscale Serve)?

Serve only exposes the **Gateway Control UI**. Nodes use the **bridge port**.

Recommended setup:
1) **Enable the bridge on the gateway host**:
   ```json5
   {
     bridge: { enabled: true, bind: "auto" }
   }
   ```
   `auto` prefers a tailnet IP when Tailscale is present.
2) **Make sure the VPS + Mac are on the same tailnet**.
3) **Use the macOS app in Remote mode** (SSH target can be the tailnet hostname).
   The app will tunnel the bridge port and connect as a node.
4) **Approve the node** on the gateway:
   ```bash
   clawdbot nodes pending
   clawdbot nodes approve <requestId>
   ```

Docs: [Bridge protocol](/gateway/bridge-protocol), [Discovery](/gateway/discovery), [macOS remote mode](/platforms/mac/remote).

## Env vars and .env loading

### How does Clawdbot load environment variables?

Clawdbot reads env vars from the parent process (shell, launchd/systemd, CI, etc.) and additionally loads:

- `.env` from the current working directory
- a global fallback `.env` from `~/.clawdbot/.env` (aka `$CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR/.env`)

Neither `.env` file overrides existing env vars.

You can also define inline env vars in config (applied only if missing from the process env):

```json5
{
  env: {
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY: "sk-or-...",
    vars: { GROQ_API_KEY: "gsk-..." }
  }
}
```

See [/environment](/environment) for full precedence and sources.

### “I started the Gateway via a daemon and my env vars disappeared.” What now?

Two common fixes:

1) Put the missing keys in `~/.clawdbot/.env` so they’re picked up even when the daemon doesn’t inherit your shell env.
2) Enable shell import (opt‑in convenience):

```json5
{
  env: {
    shellEnv: {
      enabled: true,
      timeoutMs: 15000
    }
  }
}
```

This runs your login shell and imports only missing expected keys (never overrides). Env var equivalents:
`CLAWDBOT_LOAD_SHELL_ENV=1`, `CLAWDBOT_SHELL_ENV_TIMEOUT_MS=15000`.

### I set `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, but models status shows “Shell env: off.” Why?

`clawdbot models status` reports whether **shell env import** is enabled. “Shell env: off”
does **not** mean your env vars are missing — it just means Clawdbot won’t load
your login shell automatically.

If the Gateway runs as a daemon (launchd/systemd), it won’t inherit your shell
environment. Fix by doing one of these:

1) Put the token in `~/.clawdbot/.env`:
   ```
   COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=...
   ```
2) Or enable shell import (`env.shellEnv.enabled: true`).
3) Or add it to your config `env` block (applies only if missing).

Then restart the gateway and recheck:
```bash
clawdbot models status
```

Copilot tokens are read from `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` (also `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`).
See [/concepts/model-providers](/concepts/model-providers) and [/environment](/environment).

## Sessions & multiple chats

### How do I start a fresh conversation?

Send `/new` or `/reset` as a standalone message. See [Session management](/concepts/session).

### How do I completely reset Clawdbot (but keep it installed)?

Use the reset command:

```bash
clawdbot reset
```

Non-interactive full reset:

```bash
clawdbot reset --scope full --yes --non-interactive
```

Then re-run onboarding:

```bash
clawdbot onboard --install-daemon
```

Notes:
- The onboarding wizard also offers **Reset** if it sees an existing config. See [Wizard](/start/wizard).
- If you used profiles (`--profile` / `CLAWDBOT_PROFILE`), reset each state dir (defaults are `~/.clawdbot-<profile>`).
- Dev reset: `clawdbot gateway --dev --reset` (dev-only; wipes dev config + credentials + sessions + workspace).

### I’m getting “context too large” errors — how do I reset or compact?

Use one of these:

- **Compact** (keeps the conversation but summarizes older turns):
  ```
  /compact
  ```
  or `/compact <instructions>` to guide the summary.

- **Reset** (fresh session ID for the same chat key):
  ```
  /new
  /reset
  ```

If it keeps happening:
- Enable or tune **session pruning** (`agents.defaults.contextPruning`) to trim old tool output.
- Use a model with a larger context window.

Docs: [Compaction](/concepts/compaction), [Session pruning](/concepts/session-pruning), [Session management](/concepts/session).

### Do I need to add a “bot account” to a WhatsApp group?

No. Clawdbot runs on **your own account**, so if you’re in the group, Clawdbot can see it.
By default, group replies are blocked until you allow senders (`groupPolicy: "allowlist"`).

If you want only **you** to be able to trigger group replies:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      groupPolicy: "allowlist",
      groupAllowFrom: ["+15551234567"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Why doesn’t Clawdbot reply in a group?

Two common causes:
- Mention gating is on (default). You must @mention the bot (or match `mentionPatterns`).
- You configured `channels.whatsapp.groups` without `"*"` and the group isn’t allowlisted.

See [Groups](/concepts/groups) and [Group messages](/concepts/group-messages).

### Do groups/threads share context with DMs?

Direct chats collapse to the main session by default. Groups/channels have their own session keys, and Telegram topics / Discord threads are separate sessions. See [Groups](/concepts/groups) and [Group messages](/concepts/group-messages).

## Models: defaults, selection, aliases, switching

### What is the “default model”?

Clawdbot’s default model is whatever you set as:

```
agents.defaults.model.primary
```

Models are referenced as `provider/model` (example: `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`). If you omit the provider, Clawdbot currently assumes `anthropic` as a temporary deprecation fallback — but you should still **explicitly** set `provider/model`.

### How do I switch models on the fly (without restarting)?

Use the `/model` command as a standalone message:

```
/model sonnet
/model haiku
/model opus
/model gpt
/model gpt-mini
/model gemini
/model gemini-flash
```

You can list available models with `/model`, `/model list`, or `/model status`.

`/model` (and `/model list`) shows a compact, numbered picker. Select by number:

```
/model 3
```

You can also force a specific auth profile for the provider (per session):

```
/model opus@anthropic:claude-cli
/model opus@anthropic:default
```

Tip: `/model status` shows which agent is active, which `auth-profiles.json` file is being used, and which auth profile will be tried next.
It also shows the configured provider endpoint (`baseUrl`) and API mode (`api`) when available.

### Why do I see “Model … is not allowed” and then no reply?

If `agents.defaults.models` is set, it becomes the **allowlist** for `/model` and any
session overrides. Choosing a model that isn’t in that list returns:

```
Model "provider/model" is not allowed. Use /model to list available models.
```

That error is returned **instead of** a normal reply. Fix: add the model to
`agents.defaults.models`, remove the allowlist, or pick a model from `/model list`.

### Why do I see “Unknown model: minimax/MiniMax-M2.1”?

This means the **provider isn’t configured** (no MiniMax provider config or auth
profile was found), so the model can’t be resolved. A fix for this detection is
in **2026.1.12** (unreleased at the time of writing).

Fix checklist:
1) Upgrade to **2026.1.12** (or run from source `main`), then restart the gateway.
2) Make sure MiniMax is configured (wizard or JSON), or that a MiniMax API key
   exists in env/auth profiles so the provider can be injected.
3) Use the exact model id (case‑sensitive): `minimax/MiniMax-M2.1` or
   `minimax/MiniMax-M2.1-lightning`.
4) Run:
   ```bash
   clawdbot models list
   ```
   and pick from the list (or `/model list` in chat).

See [MiniMax](/providers/minimax) and [Models](/concepts/models).

### Can I use MiniMax as my default and OpenAI for complex tasks?

Yes. Use **MiniMax as the default** and switch models **per session** when needed.
Fallbacks are for **errors**, not “hard tasks,” so use `/model` or a separate agent.

**Option A: switch per session**
```json5
{
  env: { MINIMAX_API_KEY: "sk-...", OPENAI_API_KEY: "sk-..." },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "minimax/MiniMax-M2.1" },
      models: {
        "minimax/MiniMax-M2.1": { alias: "minimax" },
        "openai/gpt-5.2": { alias: "gpt" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then:
```
/model gpt
```

**Option B: separate agents**
- Agent A default: MiniMax
- Agent B default: OpenAI
- Route by agent or use `/agent` to switch

Docs: [Models](/concepts/models), [Multi-Agent Routing](/concepts/multi-agent), [MiniMax](/providers/minimax), [OpenAI](/providers/openai).

### Are opus / sonnet / gpt built‑in shortcuts?

Yes. Clawdbot ships a few default shorthands (only applied when the model exists in `agents.defaults.models`):

- `opus` → `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`
- `sonnet` → `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`
- `gpt` → `openai/gpt-5.2`
- `gpt-mini` → `openai/gpt-5-mini`
- `gemini` → `google/gemini-3-pro-preview`
- `gemini-flash` → `google/gemini-3-flash-preview`

If you set your own alias with the same name, your value wins.

### How do I define/override model shortcuts (aliases)?

Aliases come from `agents.defaults.models.<modelId>.alias`. Example:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5" },
      models: {
        "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5": { alias: "opus" },
        "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5": { alias: "sonnet" },
        "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5": { alias: "haiku" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then `/model sonnet` (or `/<alias>` when supported) resolves to that model ID.

### How do I add models from other providers like OpenRouter or Z.AI?

OpenRouter (pay‑per‑token; many models):

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5" },
      models: { "openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5": {} }
    }
  },
  env: { OPENROUTER_API_KEY: "sk-or-..." }
}
```

Z.AI (GLM models):

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "zai/glm-4.7" },
      models: { "zai/glm-4.7": {} }
    }
  },
  env: { ZAI_API_KEY: "..." }
}
```

If you reference a provider/model but the required provider key is missing, you’ll get a runtime auth error (e.g. `No API key found for provider "zai"`).

## Model failover and “All models failed”

### How does failover work?

Failover happens in two stages:

1) **Auth profile rotation** within the same provider.
2) **Model fallback** to the next model in `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks`.

Cooldowns apply to failing profiles (exponential backoff), so Clawdbot can keep responding even when a provider is rate‑limited or temporarily failing.

### What does this error mean?

```
No credentials found for profile "anthropic:default"
```

It means the system attempted to use the auth profile ID `anthropic:default`, but could not find credentials for it in the expected auth store.

### Fix checklist for `No credentials found for profile "anthropic:default"`

- **Confirm where auth profiles live** (new vs legacy paths)
  - Current: `~/.clawdbot/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json`
  - Legacy: `~/.clawdbot/agent/*` (migrated by `clawdbot doctor`)
- **Confirm your env var is loaded by the Gateway**
  - If you set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your shell but run the Gateway via systemd/launchd, it may not inherit it. Put it in `~/.clawdbot/.env` or enable `env.shellEnv`.
- **Make sure you’re editing the correct agent**
  - Multi‑agent setups mean there can be multiple `auth-profiles.json` files.
- **Sanity‑check model/auth status**
  - Use `clawdbot models status` to see configured models and whether providers are authenticated.

### Fix checklist for `No credentials found for profile "anthropic:claude-cli"`

This means the run is pinned to the **Claude Code CLI** profile, but the Gateway
can’t find that profile in its auth store.

- **Sync the Claude Code CLI token on the gateway host**
  - Run `clawdbot models status` (it loads + syncs Claude Code CLI credentials).
  - If it still says missing: run `claude setup-token` (or `clawdbot models auth setup-token --provider anthropic`) and retry.
- **If you want to use an API key instead**
  - Put `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `~/.clawdbot/.env` on the **gateway host**.
  - Clear any pinned order that forces `anthropic:claude-cli`:
    ```bash
    clawdbot models auth order clear --provider anthropic
    ```
- **Confirm you’re running commands on the gateway host**
  - In remote mode, auth profiles live on the gateway machine, not your laptop.

### Why did it also try Google Gemini and fail?

If your model config includes Google Gemini as a fallback (or you switched to a Gemini shorthand), Clawdbot will try it during model fallback. If you haven’t configured Google credentials, you’ll see `No API key found for provider "google"`.

Fix: either provide Google auth, or remove/avoid Google models in `agents.defaults.model.fallbacks` / aliases so fallback doesn’t route there.

## Auth profiles: what they are and how to manage them

Related: [/concepts/oauth](/concepts/oauth) (OAuth flows, token storage, multi-account patterns, CLI sync)

### What is an auth profile?

An auth profile is a named credential record (OAuth or API key) tied to a provider. Profiles live in:

```
~/.clawdbot/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json
```

### What are typical profile IDs?

Clawdbot uses provider‑prefixed IDs like:

- `anthropic:default` (common when no email identity exists)
- `anthropic:<email>` for OAuth identities
- custom IDs you choose (e.g. `anthropic:work`)

### Can I control which auth profile is tried first?

Yes. Config supports optional metadata for profiles and an ordering per provider (`auth.order.<provider>`). This does **not** store secrets; it maps IDs to provider/mode and sets rotation order.

Clawdbot may temporarily skip a profile if it’s in a short **cooldown** (rate limits/timeouts/auth failures) or a longer **disabled** state (billing/insufficient credits). To inspect this, run `clawdbot models status --json` and check `auth.unusableProfiles`. Tuning: `auth.cooldowns.billingBackoffHours*`.

You can also set a **per-agent** order override (stored in that agent’s `auth-profiles.json`) via the CLI:

```bash
# Defaults to the configured default agent (omit --agent)
clawdbot models auth order get --provider anthropic

# Lock rotation to a single profile (only try this one)
clawdbot models auth order set --provider anthropic anthropic:claude-cli

# Or set an explicit order (fallback within provider)
clawdbot models auth order set --provider anthropic anthropic:claude-cli anthropic:default

# Clear override (fall back to config auth.order / round-robin)
clawdbot models auth order clear --provider anthropic
```

To target a specific agent:

```bash
clawdbot models auth order set --provider anthropic --agent main anthropic:claude-cli
```

### OAuth vs API key: what’s the difference?

Clawdbot supports both:

- **OAuth** often leverages subscription access (where applicable).
- **API keys** use pay‑per‑token billing.

The wizard explicitly supports Anthropic OAuth and OpenAI Codex OAuth and can store API keys for you.

## Gateway: ports, “already running”, and remote mode

### What port does the Gateway use?

`gateway.port` controls the single multiplexed port for WebSocket + HTTP (Control UI, hooks, etc.).

Precedence:

```
--port > CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_PORT > gateway.port > default 18789
```

### Why does `clawdbot daemon status` say `Runtime: running` but `RPC probe: failed`?

Because “running” is the **supervisor’s** view (launchd/systemd/schtasks). The RPC probe is the CLI actually connecting to the gateway WebSocket and calling `status`.

Use `clawdbot daemon status` and trust these lines:
- `Probe target:` (the URL the probe actually used)
- `Listening:` (what’s actually bound on the port)
- `Last gateway error:` (common root cause when the process is alive but the port isn’t listening)

### Why does `clawdbot daemon status` show `Config (cli)` and `Config (daemon)` different?

You’re editing one config file while the daemon is running another (often a `--profile` / `CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR` mismatch).

Fix:
```bash
clawdbot daemon install --force
```
Run that from the same `--profile` / environment you want the daemon to use.

### What does “another gateway instance is already listening” mean?

Clawdbot enforces a runtime lock by binding the WebSocket listener immediately on startup (default `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`). If the bind fails with `EADDRINUSE`, it throws `GatewayLockError` indicating another instance is already listening.

Fix: stop the other instance, free the port, or run with `clawdbot gateway --port <port>`.

### How do I run Clawdbot in remote mode (client connects to a Gateway elsewhere)?

Set `gateway.mode: "remote"` and point to a remote WebSocket URL, optionally with a token/password:

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    mode: "remote",
    remote: {
      url: "ws://gateway.tailnet:18789",
      token: "your-token",
      password: "your-password"
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- `clawdbot gateway` only starts when `gateway.mode` is `local` (or you pass the override flag).
- The macOS app watches the config file and switches modes live when these values change.

### The Control UI says “unauthorized” (or keeps reconnecting). What now?

Your gateway is running with auth enabled (`gateway.auth.*`), but the UI is not sending the matching token/password.

Facts (from code):
- The Control UI stores the token in browser localStorage key `clawdbot.control.settings.v1`.
- The UI can import `?token=...` (and/or `?password=...`) once, then strips it from the URL.

Fix:
- Fastest: `clawdbot dashboard` (prints + copies tokenized link, tries to open; shows SSH hint if headless).
- If remote, tunnel first: `ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@host` then open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/?token=...`.
- Set `gateway.auth.token` (or `CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN`) on the gateway host.
- In the Control UI settings, paste the same token (or refresh with a one-time `?token=...` link).

### I set `gateway.bind: "tailnet"` but it can’t bind / nothing listens

`tailnet` bind picks a Tailscale IP from your network interfaces (100.64.0.0/10). If the machine isn’t on Tailscale (or the interface is down), there’s nothing to bind to.

Fix:
- Start Tailscale on that host (so it has a 100.x address), or
- Switch to `gateway.bind: "loopback"` / `"lan"`.
  
Note: `tailnet` is legacy and is migrated to `auto` by Doctor. Prefer `gateway.bind: "auto"` when using Tailscale.

### Can I run multiple Gateways on the same host?

Usually no — one Gateway can run multiple messaging channels and agents. Use multiple Gateways only when you need redundancy (ex: rescue bot) or hard isolation.

Yes, but you must isolate:

- `CLAWDBOT_CONFIG_PATH` (per‑instance config)
- `CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR` (per‑instance state)
- `agents.defaults.workspace` (workspace isolation)
- `gateway.port` (unique ports)

Quick setup (recommended):
- Use `clawdbot --profile <name> …` per instance (auto-creates `~/.clawdbot-<name>`).
- Set a unique `gateway.port` in each profile config (or pass `--port` for manual runs).
- Install a per-profile daemon: `clawdbot --profile <name> daemon install`.

Profiles also suffix service names (`com.clawdbot.<profile>`, `clawdbot-gateway-<profile>.service`, `Clawdbot Gateway (<profile>)`).

### What does “invalid handshake” / code 1008 mean?

The Gateway is a **WebSocket server**, and it expects the very first message to
be a `connect` frame. If it receives anything else, it closes the connection
with **code 1008** (policy violation).

Common causes:
- You opened the **HTTP** URL in a browser (`http://...`) instead of a WS client.
- You used the wrong port or path.
- A proxy or tunnel stripped auth headers or sent a non‑Gateway request.

Quick fixes:
1) Use the WS URL: `ws://<host>:18789` (or `wss://...` if HTTPS).
2) Don’t open the WS port in a normal browser tab.
3) If auth is on, include the token/password in the `connect` frame.

If you’re using the CLI or TUI, the URL should look like:
```
clawdbot tui --url ws://<host>:18789 --token <token>
```

Protocol details: [Gateway protocol](/gateway/protocol).

## Logging and debugging

### Where are logs?

File logs (structured):

```
/tmp/clawdbot/clawdbot-YYYY-MM-DD.log
```

You can set a stable path via `logging.file`. File log level is controlled by `logging.level`. Console verbosity is controlled by `--verbose` and `logging.consoleLevel`.

Fastest log tail:

```bash
clawdbot logs --follow
```

Service/supervisor logs (when the gateway runs via launchd/systemd):
- macOS: `$CLAWDBOT_STATE_DIR/logs/gateway.log` and `gateway.err.log` (default: `~/.clawdbot/logs/...`; profiles use `~/.clawdbot-<profile>/logs/...`)
- Linux: `journalctl --user -u clawdbot-gateway[-<profile>].service -n 200 --no-pager`
- Windows: `schtasks /Query /TN "Clawdbot Gateway (<profile>)" /V /FO LIST`

See [Troubleshooting](/gateway/troubleshooting#log-locations) for more.

### How do I start/stop/restart the Gateway daemon?

Use the daemon helpers:

```bash
clawdbot daemon status
clawdbot daemon restart
```

If you run the gateway manually, `clawdbot gateway --force` can reclaim the port. See [Gateway](/gateway).

### What’s the fastest way to get more details when something fails?

Start the Gateway with `--verbose` to get more console detail. Then inspect the log file for channel auth, model routing, and RPC errors.

## Media & attachments

### My skill generated an image/PDF, but nothing was sent

Outbound attachments from the agent must include a `MEDIA:<path-or-url>` line (on its own line). See [Clawdbot assistant setup](/start/clawd) and [Agent send](/tools/agent-send).

CLI sending:

```bash
clawdbot message send --to +15555550123 --message "Here you go" --media /path/to/file.png
```

Note: images are resized/recompressed (max side 2048px) to hit size limits. See [Images](/nodes/images).

## Security and access control

### Is it safe to expose Clawdbot to inbound DMs?

Treat inbound DMs as untrusted input. Defaults are designed to reduce risk:

- Default behavior on DM‑capable channels is **pairing**:
  - Unknown senders receive a pairing code; the bot does not process their message.
  - Approve with: `clawdbot pairing approve <channel> <code>`
  - Pending requests are capped at **3 per channel**; check `clawdbot pairing list <channel>` if a code didn’t arrive.
- Opening DMs publicly requires explicit opt‑in (`dmPolicy: "open"` and allowlist `"*"`).

Run `clawdbot doctor` to surface risky DM policies.

### WhatsApp: will it message my contacts? How does pairing work?

No. Default WhatsApp DM policy is **pairing**. Unknown senders only get a pairing code and their message is **not processed**. Clawdbot only replies to chats it receives or to explicit sends you trigger.

Approve pairing with:

```bash
clawdbot pairing approve whatsapp <code>
```

List pending requests:

```bash
clawdbot pairing list whatsapp
```

Wizard phone number prompt: it’s used to set your **allowlist/owner** so your own DMs are permitted. It’s not used for auto-sending. If you run on your personal WhatsApp number, use that number and enable `channels.whatsapp.selfChatMode`.

## Chat commands, aborting tasks, and “it won’t stop”

### How do I stop/cancel a running task?

Send any of these **as a standalone message** (no slash):

```
stop
abort
esc
wait
exit
```

These are abort triggers (not slash commands).

For background processes (from the exec tool), you can ask the agent to run:

```
process action:kill sessionId:XXX
```

Slash commands overview: see [Slash commands](/tools/slash-commands).

Most commands must be sent as a **standalone** message that starts with `/`, but a few shortcuts (like `/status`) also work inline for allowlisted senders.

### Why does it feel like the bot “ignores” rapid‑fire messages?

Queue mode controls how new messages interact with an in‑flight run. Use `/queue` to change modes:

- `steer` — new messages redirect the current task
- `followup` — run messages one at a time
- `collect` — batch messages and reply once (default)
- `steer-backlog` — steer now, then process backlog
- `interrupt` — abort current run and start fresh

You can add options like `debounce:2s cap:25 drop:summarize` for followup modes.

## Common troubleshooting

### “All models failed” — what should I check first?

- **Credentials** present for the provider(s) being tried (auth profiles + env vars).
- **Model routing**: confirm `agents.defaults.model.primary` and fallbacks are models you can access.
- **Gateway logs** in `/tmp/clawdbot/…` for the exact provider error.
- **`/model status`** to see current configured models + shorthands.

### I’m running on my personal WhatsApp number — why is self-chat weird?

Enable self-chat mode and allowlist your own number:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      selfChatMode: true,
      dmPolicy: "allowlist",
      allowFrom: ["+15555550123"]
    }
  }
}
```

See [WhatsApp setup](/channels/whatsapp).

### WhatsApp logged me out. How do I re‑auth?

Run the login command again and scan the QR code:

```bash
clawdbot channels login
```

### Build errors on `main` — what’s the standard fix path?

1) `git pull origin main && pnpm install`
2) `pnpm clawdbot doctor`
3) Check GitHub issues or Discord
4) Temporary workaround: check out an older commit

### npm install fails (allow-build-scripts / missing tar or yargs). What now?

If you’re running from source, use the repo’s package manager: **pnpm** (preferred).
The repo declares `packageManager: "pnpm@…"`, and pnpm patches are tracked in `pnpm.patchedDependencies`.

Typical recovery:
```bash
git status   # ensure you’re in the repo root
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm clawdbot doctor
clawdbot daemon restart
```

Why: pnpm is the configured package manager for this repo, and the dependency
patching workflow relies on it.

### How do I switch between git installs and npm installs?

Use the **website installer** and select the install method with a flag. It
upgrades in place and rewrites the gateway service to point at the new install.

Switch **to git install**:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash -s -- --install-method git --no-onboard
```

Switch **to npm global**:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
```

Notes:
- The git flow only rebases if the repo is clean. Commit or stash changes first.
- After switching, run:
  ```bash
  clawdbot doctor
  clawdbot daemon restart
  ```

### Telegram block streaming isn’t splitting text between tool calls. Why?

Block streaming only sends **completed text blocks**. Common reasons you see a single message:
- `agents.defaults.blockStreamingDefault` is still `"off"`.
- `channels.telegram.blockStreaming` is set to `false`.
- `channels.telegram.streamMode` is `partial` or `block` **and draft streaming is active**
  (private chat + topics). Draft streaming disables block streaming in that case.
- Your `minChars` / coalesce settings are too high, so chunks get merged.
- The model emits one large text block (no mid‑reply flush points).

Fix checklist:
1) Put block streaming settings under `agents.defaults`, not the root.
2) Set `channels.telegram.streamMode: "off"` if you want real multi‑message block replies.
3) Use smaller chunk/coalesce thresholds while debugging.

See [Streaming](/concepts/streaming).

### Discord doesn’t reply in my server even with `requireMention: false`. Why?

`requireMention` only controls mention‑gating **after** the channel passes allowlists.
By default `channels.discord.groupPolicy` is **allowlist**, so guild channels must be explicitly enabled.

Fix checklist:
1) Set `channels.discord.groupPolicy: "open"` **or** add the guild/channel allowlist.
2) Use **numeric channel IDs** in `channels.discord.guilds.<guildId>.channels`.
3) Put `requireMention: false` **under** `channels.discord.guilds` (global or per‑channel).
   Top‑level `channels.discord.requireMention` is not a supported key.
4) Ensure the bot has **Message Content Intent** and channel permissions.
5) Run `clawdbot channels status --probe` for audit hints.

Docs: [Discord](/channels/discord), [Channels troubleshooting](/channels/troubleshooting).

### Cloud Code Assist API error: invalid tool schema (400). What now?

This is almost always a **tool schema compatibility** issue. The Cloud Code Assist
endpoint accepts a strict subset of JSON Schema. Clawdbot scrubs/normalizes tool
schemas in current `main`, but the fix is not in the last release yet (as of
January 13, 2026).

Fix checklist:
1) **Update Clawdbot**:
   - If you can run from source, pull `main` and restart the gateway.
   - Otherwise, wait for the next release that includes the schema scrubber.
2) Avoid unsupported keywords like `anyOf/oneOf/allOf`, `patternProperties`,
   `additionalProperties`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `format`, etc.
3) If you define custom tools, keep the top‑level schema as `type: "object"` with
   `properties` and simple enums.

See [Tools](/tools) and [TypeBox schemas](/concepts/typebox).

## Answer the exact question from the screenshot/chat log

**Q: “What’s the default model for Anthropic with an API key?”**

**A:** In Clawdbot, credentials and model selection are separate. Setting `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or storing an Anthropic API key in auth profiles) enables authentication, but the actual default model is whatever you configure in `agents.defaults.model.primary` (for example, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` or `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`). If you see `No credentials found for profile "anthropic:default"`, it means the Gateway couldn’t find Anthropic credentials in the expected `auth-profiles.json` for the agent that’s running.
